Agentic AI characterstics:
1. Autonomous
2. Goal Oriented
3. Planning
4. Reasoning
5. Adaptability
6. Context Awareness

1. Autonomy: Refers to AI system's abality to make decision and take actions on its own to acheive a goal on its own.
Execution
Decision Making
Tool Usage

2. Goal Oriented: AI system operates with a persistant objective in mind and continously directs its action towards it.

3. Planning: Agent's ability to break down high-level goal into a structured sequence of actions or subgoals and decide best path to acheive the desired goal.

4. Reasoning: cognitive process through which an agentic ai system interprets infor draws conclusion and make decision. 
a. Planning during Execution.
b. Reasoning during Execution.

5. Adaptability: Agent's ability to modify its plans, strategies or actions in response to unexpected conditions.

6. Context awareness: agent's ability to understand, retrain and utilize relevant information form ongoing task, past interactions, user preferences, and env ues to make better decision throughout a multi step process. Short Term Memory and Long Term Memory.
